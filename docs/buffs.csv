In addition\, you will become dizzy and you will have trouble seeing. If you've had too much alcohol\, you could pass out.&lt;br&gt;The length of the positive and negative phases of drunkenness is determined by your &lt;strong&gt;Drinking skill&lt;/strong&gt;. The higher it is\, the longer the positive phase lasts and the negative phase is shorter. The drunkenness starts to decrease when all the alcohol is absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you drink frequently\, you can develop an addiction that is hard to break.&lt;/p&gt;"
